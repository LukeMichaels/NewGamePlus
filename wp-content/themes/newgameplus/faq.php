				<strong>What is NewGame+?</strong> <br />
	
				<p>NewGame+ is a site for gamers of all kinds. The idea is to build a community around games that will allow gamers to easily find information, share information, make connections, and bask in the glory that is our wonderful hobby.</p><br>
				
				<p>We've been working on a lot of unique features and we can't wait to introduce them to the world.</p>
			</div><br>
			
			<div id="only-blog">
				<strong>I only see a blog what's up with that?</strong> <br />
				
				<p>NewGame+ is currently in alpha development. During the alpha we're letting friends and family test out the site's many features so we know that everything runs smoothly before introducing them to the public.</p><br>
				
				<p>We hope to launch the beta soon, at which time we will allow more users to experience the awesome features we've been putting together. You can register for the beta and receive updates on our progress by entering your email address here:<br> <?php echo do_shortcode('[contact-form-7 id="4" title="Contact form 1"]')?></p>

				<strong>I'd like to write for your blog, how can I go about doing so?</strong> <br />
			
				<p>NewGame+ has a excellent crew of writers and editors, but there is a huge about of industry information coming out daily. We can always use help covering more of it. If you would like to write for us, please go to <a href="http://newgameplus.co/write-for-newgame/" alt="Write for NewGame+" target="_blank">this page</a> and fill out the form.</p>

			<div id="review-policy">
				<strong>I see that you review games, what are your policies?</strong> <br />
				
				<p>NewGame+ reviews games on a 10 point scale which we will detail below. We strongly feel that the current trend of "either it's an 8 or it's crap" is 100% false and we wont stand behind it. Our 10 point scale is just that, you wont see any .5s, .75s, etc.</p><br>
				
				<p>Our reviews will be fair. We understand that everyone has their bias and if our writer's have any major issues with a franchise or developer we will do our best to pass the project along to someone else (or have that writer denote their bias in the review).</p><br>
				
				<li>We will never review a re-release of a game. We may do a write-up, but no score will be associated. At some point we may do classic game reviews, but we wont use current games as a comparison when doing so.</li>
				
				<p>Our reviewers will always finish the single player mode and play the multiplayer prior to writing their review, unless otherwise noted. </p>
				
				<p>We don't take monetary value into consideration when reviewing a game. There are $60 games that aren't any good, there are $1 games that are amazing, and vice versa. We believe that the price of a game has no place in it's critique.</p><br>
				
				<b>NewGame+'s Review Scale</b> 
				<ul>
					<li><b>10 - Flawless Victory:</b> this is a must buy title that we would recommend to anyone! A legendary system seller and shining example of gaming greatness.</li>
					<li><b>09 - Amazing:</b> one of the best of the best, another must buy and a game that will be remembered as well as played for years to come.</li>
					<li><b>08 - Excellent:</b> very much worth your time. This game may not move systems, but it's well worth picking up for anyone who already owns a platform that it's available for.</li>
					<li><b>07 - Great:</b> this game may have some niggling criticisms, but it's still a solid game that will give you a lot of enjoyment.</li>
					<li><b>06 - Good:</b> over-all the game is enjoyable or at least a unique enough experience to recommend to most gamers.</li>
					<li><b>05 - Mediocre:</b> while this game isn't necessarily bad it has it's issues and doesn't really bring anything new or special to the table.</li>
					<li><b>04 - Bad:</b> this game has several issues, and we just can't bring ourselves to recommend it to our readers.</li>
					<li><b>03 - Awful:</b> this game is nearly broken, but still playable. Problems may include repetitive game-play and/or bland narrative.</li>
					<li><b>02 - Unbearable:</b> we wouldn't recommend this game to our worst enemies. It's broken and no amount of patching is going to rescue it from our trash bin.</li>
					<li><b>01 - Unplayable:</b> avoid this game like the plague, we're not even sure how it was released. It's riddled with technical flaws and lacks any purpose other than to even out that crooked coffee table that you just can't get rid of.</li>
